                    <h2>What are Eating Disorders?</h2>
                    <p>An eating disorder is a mental health condition characterized by abnormal or disturbed eating habits. These disorders are complex and can involve extreme behaviors, attitudes, and feelings surrounding food, body image, and weight.</p>

                    <h2>Common Types of Eating Disorders</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of eating disorders, each with its own unique characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Anorexia Nervosa:</strong> Characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading to extreme restriction of food intake.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bulimia Nervosa:</strong> Involves binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as purging (vomiting or excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Binge Eating Disorder:</strong> Characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food in a short period, often accompanied by feelings of shame or loss of control, but without purging.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED):</strong> A category for eating disorders that don't fit the criteria of anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder but still significantly affect a person’s health.</li>
                    </ul>
