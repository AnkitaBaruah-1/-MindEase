                    <p>A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder where a person has a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning, and behaving. These patterns typically develop during adolescence or early adulthood and can cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.
