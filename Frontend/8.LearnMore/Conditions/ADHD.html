                    <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
                    <p>ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can affect individuals of all ages and can have a significant impact on daily life, including academic performance, work, and relationships.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <h2>Symptoms of ADHD</h2>
                    <p>The symptoms of ADHD can vary from person to person, but they generally fall into two categories: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Some common symptoms include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Difficulty focusing on tasks, forgetfulness, easily distracted, and trouble following instructions or completing tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Excessive fidgeting, restlessness, inability to sit still, and being overly talkative.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Interrupting others, making hasty decisions, and struggling to wait for turns or control impulses.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Types of ADHD</h2>
                    <p>ADHD can be classified into three main types, depending on the symptoms that are most prominent:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:</strong> Individuals with this type of ADHD primarily have symptoms of inattention, such as forgetfulness and difficulty following instructions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:</strong> This type involves symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, such as being overly talkative, fidgeting, or interrupting others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Combined Presentation:</strong> Individuals with combined presentation exhibit both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>The exact cause of ADHD is not known, but research suggests that it may involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> ADHD tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disorder.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brain Structure and Function:</strong> Differences in brain structure and function may contribute to the symptoms of ADHD. Brain imaging studies show changes in areas involved in attention and impulse control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Factors such as prenatal exposure to tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, premature birth, or lead exposure can increase the risk of developing ADHD.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Diagnosis of ADHD</h2>
                    <p>ADHD is typically diagnosed through a comprehensive evaluation, which may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interviews with parents, teachers, and the individual.</li>
                        <li>Behavioral assessments and questionnaires.</li>
                        <li>Physical examinations to rule out other conditions.</li>
                        <li>Observation of the individual’s behavior in various settings, such as at home and in school or work environments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Treatment Options for ADHD</h2>
                    <p>While there is no cure for ADHD, treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes:</p>
