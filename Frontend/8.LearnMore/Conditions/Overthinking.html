                    <h2>What is Overthinking?</h2>
                    <p>Overthinking is a mental process in which an individual continuously dwells on their thoughts, often rehashing past events or imagining worst-case scenarios. This cycle of thinking can lead to anxiety, stress, and difficulty making decisions.</p>

                    <p>Here are some common signs that you might be overthinking:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Constantly replaying conversations or situations in your head.</li>

                    <h2>Why Do We Overthink?</h2>
                    <p>Overthinking can be triggered by various factors, such as stress, anxiety, fear of failure, or a lack of control in certain areas of life. It may also stem from past trauma or a deep need for perfectionism. Understanding the root cause of your overthinking is the first step in overcoming it.</p>

                            <h3>Challenge Negative Thoughts</h3>
                            <p>When you catch yourself overthinking, ask yourself whether your thoughts are realistic. Challenge irrational fears by looking for evidence to counter them.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="grid-item">
                            <h3>Practice Mindfulness</h3>
                            <p>Mindfulness techniques, such as focusing on your breathing or grounding exercises, can help you stay present and calm your mind when it starts to wander.</p>

                            <p>Limit the time you spend thinking about a particular issue. Give yourself a set amount of time to think and then move on to something else. This will prevent you from spiraling into endless rumination.</p>
