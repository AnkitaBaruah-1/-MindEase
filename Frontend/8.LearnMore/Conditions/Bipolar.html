                    <h2>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
                    <p>Bipolar Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood shifts can affect sleep, energy levels, behavior, judgment, and the ability to think clearly. Bipolar disorder can have a significant impact on an individual's relationships, work, and daily life, but it can be managed with proper treatment.</p>

                    <h2>Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                    <p>The symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary depending on the type of episode a person is experiencing—mania, hypomania, or depression. Common symptoms include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Manic Episode:</strong> Extremely high mood, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, impulsive behavior, and risky actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hypomanic Episode:</strong> A milder form of mania, with similar symptoms but less severe and not causing significant problems in daily functioning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Depressive Episode:</strong> Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite, and thoughts of death or suicide.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Types of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of bipolar disorder, which differ based on the severity and pattern of mood episodes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bipolar I Disorder:</strong> Characterized by manic episodes lasting at least 7 days or by manic symptoms that are so severe that immediate hospital care is needed. Depressive episodes often occur, usually lasting at least two weeks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bipolar II Disorder:</strong> Defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyclothymic Disorder:</strong> Periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents), but the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may contribute to its development:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, indicating a genetic component. People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) who has bipolar disorder are at higher risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brain Structure and Function:</strong> Brain imaging studies suggest that people with bipolar disorder may have subtle differences in brain structure and activity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Stress, trauma, substance abuse, or significant life changes may trigger or exacerbate symptoms, especially in people with a genetic predisposition to the disorder.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                    <p>Diagnosing bipolar disorder typically involves a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A detailed medical and psychiatric history, including a family history of mood disorders.</li>
                        <li>Assessment of mood changes, behavior patterns, and the duration of symptoms.</li>
                        <li>Use of standardized diagnostic tools like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Treatment Options for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                    <p>Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment typically involves a combination of the following:</p>

                            <h3>Medication</h3>
                            <p>Medications are often necessary to stabilize mood swings and reduce the severity of manic and depressive episodes. Common medications include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium).</li>
                                <li>Antipsychotic medications for severe mania.</li>
                                <li>Antidepressants to manage depressive episodes, often used with mood stabilizers to prevent triggering mania.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Psychotherapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be effective in managing bipolar disorder. Therapy helps individuals recognize and change negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and learn how to manage stress and mood swings.</p>
