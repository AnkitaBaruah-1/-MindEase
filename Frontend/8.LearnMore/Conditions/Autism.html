                    <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
                    <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication, behavior, and social interactions. It’s called a spectrum because it encompasses a wide range of symptoms and severity levels. People with Autism may have unique strengths and challenges that vary significantly from person to person.</p>

                    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>The causes of Autism are not fully understood, but several factors are believed to contribute to its development:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> There is evidence that genetics play a significant role in the development of Autism, with certain genes potentially increasing the risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brain Development:</strong> Differences in brain structure and function are associated with Autism, although the exact mechanisms are still being studied.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Factors such as advanced parental age, prenatal exposure to certain substances, and infections during pregnancy may contribute to the development of Autism.</li>
